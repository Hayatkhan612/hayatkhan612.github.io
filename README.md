I am a Frontend Engineer dedicated to building high-fidelity web applications that solve complex problems. This portfolio represents 'The Trinity'—three distinct engineering paths brought together into a single cohesive ecosystem:

Intelligence: Leveraging LLMs for contextual data analysis.

Collaboration: Managing live state synchronization for multi-user environments.

Analytics: Architecting responsive, data-driven interfaces for business growth."

Key Technical Pillars
Logic over Templates: Every project was manually architected to handle specific engineering hurdles, such as database race conditions and state persistence.

Performance First: Using optimized CSS Grid and hardware-accelerated animations to ensure 60fps performance across all devices.

Scalable Architecture: Modular JavaScript and React-based workflows designed for real-world growth.
